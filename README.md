Raspberry Pi Beam Profiler
==========================
**Version 1.0.0**

A platform for inexpensive automatic laser beam profiling for finding the focal position and beam width of a laser beam, using a commercial translation stage, stepper motor, raspberry pi computer and the Pi NoIR camera module.

This repository contains the electronics schematics, mechanical drawings, list of components and python codes to construct and run the Raspberry Pi Beam Profiler.

See the user guide PDF for detailed installation instructions.

The paper, currently available on the arxiv (arxiv.org/abs/...), details the operation and exemplifies some results from the beam profiler.
